# Python Learning Monorepo

A comprehensive collection of Python projects created during my journey of learning Python programming. This monorepo contains multiple independent projects organized in separate directories, each representing different concepts, challenges, and applications explored throughout the learning process.

## Repository Overview

This monorepo serves as a portfolio of Python projects developed during my learning journey. Each project is contained within its own directory and focuses on specific Python concepts, libraries, or problem domains. The structure allows for easy navigation and exploration of different aspects of Python programming.

## Projects

### [CALCULATOR(PROJECT 1)](./CALCULATOR(PROJECT 1/)
A basic calculator application that demonstrates fundamental Python concepts including:
- User input handling
- Conditional logic and pattern matching
- Exception handling
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Input validation

## About This Repository

This repository documents my progression through Python programming, starting from basic scripts to more complex applications. Each project builds upon previous knowledge while exploring new concepts and techniques.

### Structure
- Each project is contained in its own directory
- Projects are designed to be independent and self-contained
- Clear documentation is provided for each project
- Code follows Python best practices and PEP 8 guidelines

### Learning Objectives
- Master Python fundamentals (variables, data types, control structures)
- Explore object-oriented programming concepts
- Work with external libraries and frameworks
- Implement error handling and debugging techniques
- Practice code organization and documentation
